=========================

Lol ezekiel you don't have a coding style. Examples:
 
 - `/*comment*/`
 - `function doStuff(arg,arg1,   arg2){  functionCall()}`
 - iNconsistent CAPitalization
 - a shit ton of globals because screw any semblance of good practices
 - you use the goddamn double equals operator. seriously? my little sister writes better JS
 - your code is so un-DRY they're using it to stop dehydration in Africa
 - your variable names are chosen for maximum obfuscation
 - you have "code mountains" of statements nested levels deep
 - you put brackets either on the same line or next to the if statement depending on if the ln squared of the line number is odd or even
 - you use fucking strings to store falsy values
 - you don't use the !!, ||, !, or % operators because you don't know what they do

you also take credit for bugs I fix by deleting my commits and editing the file yourself.

you wiped the entire bug tracker because you couldn't figure out how to move a repo

you revert my commits at random with no explanation

so I'm putting this back here, where it should be. you get write access when you rm your repo.
